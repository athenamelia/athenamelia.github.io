Welcome! My name is Amelia Tran. I am an Analytical Data Scientist, working on hematology and early oncology projects to support product development at [Genentech, Inc.](https://www.gene.com/) I received an M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Dr. Douglas Schaubel](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/douglas-e-schaubel-phd). Before that, I graduated {\em Summa Cum Laude} and {\em Phi Beta Kappa}from Mount Holyoke College with a B.A. in Statistics and Data Science.

While at Penn, I worked on multiple kidney and liver diseases related projects, with a statistical focus on the applications of survival analysis and causal inference. Before joining Genentech, I also worked as a graduate biostatistics intern at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.](https://www.regeneron.com/) where I quantified physical activity with accelerometry data from wearable devices. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to conduct research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) where I evaluated the performance of joint model for longitudinal and survival data with applications to biliary cirrhosis, and at the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) where I built physics-informed neural networks to simulate wave propagation.

I don't conduct statistical research in my daily work but always seek opportunities to upgrade my statistical and computational skills, whether to evaluate model performance through simulation studies or tackle public health problems with novel methodologies. My current interest includes survival analysis, causal inference, and times series analysis with applications to biomedical research and health policy.
