Welcome! I am an Analytical Data Scientist working on hematology and early oncology projects at [Genentech, Inc.](https://www.gene.com/) I received an MS in Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Dr. Douglas Schaubel](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/douglas-e-schaubel-phd). Before that, I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* and *Phi Beta Kappa* from Mount Holyoke College with a BA in Statistics and Data Science.

Before Genentech, I did an internship at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.](https://www.regeneron.com/) where I quantified physical activity with accelerometry data from wearable devices. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to conduct research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) where I evaluated the performance of joint model for longitudinal and survival data in biliary cirrhosis, and the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) where I built physics-informed neural networks to simulate wave propagation.

I don't conduct research in my daily work but always seek opportunities to upgrade my statistical and computational skills. My current interest includes survival analysis, causal inference, and times series analysis.
