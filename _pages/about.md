Welcome! I am an Analytical Data Scientist at [Genentech, Inc.](https://www.gene.com/) I received an MS in Biostatistics from University of Pennsylvania. Before that, I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* and *Phi Beta Kappa* from Mount Holyoke College with a BA in Statistics and Data Science.

Before Genentech, I did an internship at [Regeneron Inc.](https://www.regeneron.com/) where I quantified physical activity with accelerometry data from wearable devices. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to conduct research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) where I evaluated the performance of joint model for longitudinal and survival data in biliary cirrhosis, and the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) where I built physics-informed neural networks to simulate wave propagation.

My current research interest includes survival analysis, causal inference, and time series. Currently, in my free time, I enjoy reading classics, practicing French, swimming, and fencing.
