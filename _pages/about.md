My name is Amelia Tran, and I am an Analytical Data Scientist at [Genentech, Inc.](https://www.gene.com/) Previously, I received an M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and a B.A. in Statistics and Data Science from Mount Holyoke College, a small liberal arts in Western Massachusetts. 

Academically, I worked on multiple kidney disease related projects, with a statistical focus on the applications of survival analysis and causal inference, under the supervision of Dr. Douglas Schaubel during my time at Penn. I also had the opportunity to conduct summer research through the QSURE program at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in Manhattan, NY as well as through the RIPS program at [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics - UCLA](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) in Los Angeles, CA as an undergraduate. Industry-wise, I worked as a graduate biostatistics intern at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.](https://www.regeneron.com/) before joining Genentech.
